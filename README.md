## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Code Canvas**, a project included in the SCS (Structure of Computer
Systems) course curriculum. **Code Canvas** aims to provide a visual coding environment
for learners. This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding,
setting up, and utilizing this product.

### 1.1. Context

In the constantly evolving landscape of programming, visual coding environments
have been gaining increasing popularity. As technology becomes more intertwined
with our lives, the need for accessible programming tools has become more
pronounced. Visual editing environments, with their graphical interfaces and
interactive components, have greatly lowered the barrier of entry to the field
of programming.

Platforms like _Scratch_ and _Blockly_ provide a thoughtful abstraction of classic
programming concepts. These environments offer an alternative to traditional
text-based coding, providing a more intuitive approach to programming concepts.
The graphical representation of code structures and the drag-and-drop
functionality make it easier for beginners to grasp fundamental programming
concepts without the immediate need to memorize syntax. This evolution aligns
with the broader trend observed in contemporary design and development tools.
Great examples of such tools would be _Web Flow_, _Framer_, and _Figma_, which
exemplify how visual editors have become a part of the workflows of professionals.

The context in with which **Code Canvas** alligns is characterized by an understanding
that programming should be a skill accessible to all.

### 1.2. Motivation

The motivation behind the **Code Canvas** project is rooted the recreation of
_Blockly_ with a handful features. While _Blockly_ has made more significant
strides in simplifying programming concepts, **Code Canvas** seeks to refine
this approach further by offering a focused subset of features.

The decision to recreate _Blocky_ with a smaller set of features is driven by a
commitment to providing a more approachable entry point into programming for users.
By including the essential components of programming languages, including if
statements, while/for loops, variables, and print statements, **Code Canvas** aims
to create an environment that facilitates understanding programming concepts.
This intentional simplification addresses the unique needs of beginners, allowing
them to build a solid foundation before delving into more advanced programming constructs.

### 1.3. Objectives

1. **Streamlined Recreation of Blockly:**

   - _Description:_ **Code Canvas** aims to recreate the simplicity of _Blockly_
     with a refined and focused set of features.

2. **Accessible Programming Education:**

   - _Description:_ The primary objective is to provide an accessible programming
     environment that aligns with the understanding that programming should be a
     skill accessible to all.

3. **Foundational Understanding of Programming Concepts:**
   - _Description:_ **Code Canvas** seeks to facilitate a foundational understanding
     of programming concepts by intentionally simplifying the learning process.
     The inclusion of essential components such as if statements, loops, variables,
     and print statements aims to build a solid foundation for beginners.

## 2. Bibliographic Study

In the development of **Code Canvas**, the selection of technologies and tools
dictated the architecture and functionality of the visual coding environment.

### 2.1. Programming Languages and Frameworks

#### 2.1.1. TypeScript

_TypeScript_, a superset of _JavaScript_, was chosen as the primary programming
language. Its static typing apabilities provide enhanced code quality and
improved developer productivity. The strong type-checking helps catch errors
during development, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase.

#### 2.1.2. React

The project leverages _React_, a widely adopted JavaScript library for building
user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for the creation of
modular and reusable UI elements, facilitating the development of a dynamic
and responsive visual coding environment.

### 2.2. Styling

#### 2.2.1. TailwindCSS

_TailwindCSS_ was employed for styling in **Code Canvas**. Its utility-first
approach and flexibility allowed for rapid styling and a consistent design
language throughout the application.

#### 2.2.2. shadcn/ui

The _shadcn/ui_ component library played a crucial role in enhancing the user
interface of **Code Canvas**. Leveraging pre-built components from this library
not only sped-up development but also contributed to a cohesive and aesthetically
pleasing design.

### 2.3. Tools

#### 2.3.1. Vite

_Vite_ was chosen as the build tool. Its speed and efficiency in module
bundling, coupled with features like hot module replacement (HMR), significantly
expedited the development workflow. Vite's seamless integration with _TypeScript_
and _React_ contributed to a smooth and optimized development experience.

#### 2.3.2. ESLint

_ESLint_ is employed for static code analysis in **Code Canvas**. Its configurable
rules and automatic code fixing contribute to identifying potential issues early
in the development process.

#### 2.3.3. Prettier

_Prettier_ is utilized for code formatting. Its opinionated approach to code
styling ensures a standardized and visually appealing codebase.

### 2.4. Testing Frameworks

#### 2.4.1. Vitest

_Vitest_ is utilized for unit testing. Its simplicity and integration with the
_Vite_ ecosystem make it a suitable choice for validating the functionality of
individual units of code.

#### 2.4.2. Cypress

_Cypress_ is employed for end-to-end testing. Its comprehensive testing capabilities,
including real-time interaction with the application, ensure a robust evaluation
of the application's behavior in a simulated user environment.
